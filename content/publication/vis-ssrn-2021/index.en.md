abstract: "Focusing on the interindustry aspect of the structural economic dynamics (SED) to yield a non-autarchic perspective to the vertically integrated sectors (VIS), we go a step further in establishing that productivity growth at the industry level is transmitted via inter and intra-sectoral pecuniary spillovers. To accomplish this task, we deal with technical aspects of shifting from inter-industry to vertically integrated analysis. Besides, dimensions of the Kaldor-Verdoorn (KV) law are selectively embedded in Pasinettiâ€™s multisectoral model, thus rendering technical change endogenous. With this approach, we take into account both external and internal economies of scale, allowing us to formally reconcile the KV and Smith-Young (SY) views on cumulative causation and increasing returns. We highlight that the interdependent nature of the VIS impacts the capability of spreading pecuniary externalities throughout the economy."
