abstract = {The paper aims to analyze the features of the Brazilian structural change process in the period from 2000 to 2014. More specifically, we investigate the intensity and nature of the deindustrialization process in sub-periods of the whole period under consideration. To overcome some limitations of the indicators used by the later literature (the sectoral gross output, value-added and employment shares), we apply an I-O structural decomposition methodology that takes the effect of relative prices explicitly to examine the contributions of different factors to the growth of total gross output and its composition. We utilize a series of I-O Matrices valued at constant prices constructed by the GIC-UFRJ for the period 2000-2014, based on partial information from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics. Moreover, in our analysis, we regroup the whole set of extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups according to the classification proposed by the GIC-UFRJ: processed agricultural commodities, traditional industry, industrial commodities, and innovative industry. Such classification allows us to interpret some distinctive characteristics of the Brazilian's productive structure since it captures specific features of the competition and technological flow patterns prevailing in the Brazilian economy in the period. The I-O structural decomposition analysis of the database described leads us to develop a different perspective in the debate about the Brazilian deindustrialization process. According to this perspective, this process is less intense and continuous than literature characterizes it. In particular, we show that it is more significantly intense in the sub-period after the 2008 world crises and in the case of the traditional and innovative industries groups.},

abstract = {This book describes ggplot2, a new data visualization package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. With ggplot2, it's easy to:produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specificationsuperpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scalesadd customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regressionsave any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reusecreate custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plotsapproach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot.This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, to and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page.},

abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of untidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract = {We present a coding system combined with an annotation tool for the analysis of gestural behavior. The NEUROGES coding system consists of three modules that progress from gesture kinetics to gesture function. Grounded on empirical neuropsychological and psychological studies, the theoretical assumption behind NEUROGES is that its main kinetic and functional movement categories are differentially associated with specific cognitive, emotional, and interactive functions. ELAN is a free, multimodal annotation tool for digital audio and video media. It supports multileveled transcription and complies with such standards as XML and Unicode. ELAN allows gesture categories to be stored with associated vocabularies that are reusable by means of template files. The combination of the NEUROGES coding system and the annotation tool ELAN creates an effective tool for empirical research on gestural behavior. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},
